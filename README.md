# rustlings-idiomatic-solutions
A curated collection of solutions to the 
[rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises

Similar structure to the rustlings exercises, except there is a 
directory for each exercise in the form:

./exercises/example/solve1.rs -> ./exercises/example/solve1.rs_/solve1.rs  

The trailing "_" prevents name collision and enables us to have multiple
 examples for each exercise, demonstrating both good and bad examples.
